# üöÄ STM32 Bare-Metal Programming Journey (NUCLEO-F401RE)

Welcome to my embedded systems learning repository focused on **bare-metal programming** using the **STM32F401RE (NUCLEO-F401RE)** development board. This project is part of my journey to master low-level embedded firmware development, emphasizing **direct register-level programming** without abstraction layers like HAL or CubeMX.

---

## üìå Objective

To build a strong foundation in **embedded firmware development** by:

- Understanding ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller architecture
- Programming directly with CMSIS and STM32 reference manuals
- Building peripheral drivers from scratch (GPIO, SysTick, EXTI, UART, etc.)
- Applying low-level programming techniques suitable for automotive and industrial applications

---

## üß† Skills Acquired

- Bitwise operations & register manipulation
- Peripheral initialization via RCC, GPIO, SYSCFG, EXTI, NVIC
- Interrupt-driven programming (EXTI, NVIC)
- Delay generation using SysTick timer
- Working with microcontroller documentation (RM0368, DS, etc.)
- Bare-metal project setup and debugging in Keil uVision
