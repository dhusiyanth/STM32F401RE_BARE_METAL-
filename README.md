# STM32F401RE_BARE_METAL-
This repository documents my step-by-step journey into STM32F401RE bare-metal embedded development using CMSIS. It focuses on low-level peripheral control through direct register accessâ€”without relying on HAL libraries. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of ARM Cortex-M4 architecture, peripheral interfacing, and real-time embedded systems.
